# statplot python statistical analysis toolkit

[![PyPI Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/statplot.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/statplot/) [![PythonVersion](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6%20%7C%203.7%20%7C%203.8-blue)](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6%20%7C%203.7%20%7C%203.8-blue)



**Statplot** is a statistical data analysis module in Python for machine learning. It provides a flexible and easy to use library for optimal data analysis and model training for machine learning algorithms. This python package aims to be a fundamentally high level building block for  carrying out high level statistical infereence and optimal data analysis in a most simoplified way for optimal output and results. Furthermore, it is an open source package for carrying out a wide variety of statistical data analysis.

##Â Main Features 
Statplot comes with statistical algorithms and moduls for carrying out **Binomial and Gaussian distributions** for effective data visualisation and analysis in machinen learning and model training.
